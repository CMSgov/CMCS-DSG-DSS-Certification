# Using CMS Box (FedRAMP-Authorized) in the Certification Process

In accordance with 42 C.F.R. §§ 433.112(b)(15) and 433.116(b), (c), and (i) and to support the work of Streamlined Modular Certification (SMC) framework, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses Box to easily upload files for certification and operational reporting, including secure file exchange and storage of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) files. The Box Cloud Content Management Platform has achieved numerous U.S. Government certifications for privacy and security regulatory and compliance, including, but not limited to, FedRAMP Moderate, DoD SRG IL4, NIST SP 800-171, AICPA SOC 2/SOC 3/AT 101 Type II, IRS Publication 1075, and HIPAA. 

## Standard Box Configuration

Your CMS State Officer will establish a single Box folder for each individual module or system undergoing certification contained in the state’s root folder under the certification and metrics data folder. Sub-folders for an Operational Readiness Review (ORR) and a Certification Review (CR) will be created as follows:

| **State Name or Territory Name** |
| -------------------------------- |
| -	State or Territory Abbreviation and Module Abbreviation (see below table for module abbreviations) |
| **ORR** |
| ------- |
| - 	Evidence* – should contain the Intake Form and two subfolders:
    - 	CEF – should contain the evidence listed in the Intake Form for applicable Conditions for Enhanced Funding. There is no need for additional sub-folders.
    - 	Outcomes – should contain the evidence listed in the Intake Form for applicable CMS-required and state-specific outcomes. If needed, include additional sub-folders by outcome.
- Metrics – should contain the metrics definitions for ORR. CMS highly encourages states to use the Operational Report Workbook.
- Presentation – should contain the presentation for the day of the review and any other meeting documentation.
- Required Artifacts – should contain the applicable Required Artifacts listed in Appendix C of the Streamlined Modular Certification for Medicaid Enterprise Systems Certification Guidance. |
| **CR** |
