# Conditions for Enhanced Funding (CEF)

## Overview
Regulatory requirements that span business areas, previously called “enterprise,” are now Conditions for Enhanced Funding (CEF) and mirror the “Standards and Conditions” in regulation. Under SMC, CMS significantly reduced number of requirements from 5 core MECT checklists to 22 conditions. 

States must attest that the system complies with all the CEF outlined at [42 CFR 433.112](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-C/part-433/subpart-C/section-433.112) and that the system remains in compliance with Medicaid program standards, laws, regulations, and industry best practices once it is in production.

## Conditions for Enhanced Funding
The information in the following table contains the Conditions for Enhanced Funding (CEF) described in 42 C.F.R. § 433.112 that are applicable for all MES modules.

This table, combined with the applicable business area outcomes, are a starting point for aligning the state’s goals for a project with applicable CMS-required outcomes.
