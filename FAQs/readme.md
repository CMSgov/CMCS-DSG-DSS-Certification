## Overview of SMC {#overview}

### Q1: What is SMC?
A: Streamlined Modular Certification (SMC) is the process for certifying discrete Medicaid information technology (IT) systems. State Medicaid Agencies use these IT systems and modules, known as Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES), to manage, monitor, and administer their Medicaid program. The SMC framework promotes reduced burden and increased flexibility for states while ensuring states meet federal requirements (and state-specific outcomes) for systems and modules.

SMC contains the following certification elements:
-	Conditions for Enhanced Funding that require ongoing state compliance.
-	CMS-required outcomes are based on statutory or regulatory requirements to promote the efficient, economical, and effective administration of the state’s Medicaid program.
-	State-specific outcomes that reflect the unique circumstances, characteristics, or program priorities that the state’s IT project will directly address while ensuring benefit to the state’s Medicaid program.
-	Metrics to provide evidence about whether the outcomes are achieved continuously.
-	Required artifacts are required for certification. These are documents that demonstrate the progression of a state’s IT project.

For all systems that comprise the MES, SMC is designed to:
-	Enhance collaboration between CMS and states to focus certification on demonstrated evidence to achieve business goals for state Medicaid programs.
-	Leverage data and testing to better inform CMS’s assessment of the successful delivery of systems and better inform subsequent funding decisions.

### Q2: How can I learn about the new SMC process and requirements? 
A: The [State Medicaid Director Letter (SMDL) # 22-001](https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/smd22001.pdf) and the [SMC Guidance](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-and-systems/downloads/smc-certification-guidance.pdf) are the primary sources of information on the SMC process and requirements. Materials and tools are available to help facilitate the SMC process on [Medicaid.gov](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-systems/certification/streamlined-modular-certification/index.html) and the MES Certification Repository on GitHub.  

### Q3: How does SMC differ from Outcomes-Based Certification (OBC)?
A: CMS only uses the OBC to determine Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) module certification. CMS uses the SMC to receive certification requests for all other Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) and Eligibility & Enrollment (E&E) modules.

## What States Must Know about the SMC Process {#impact}

### Q4: Why will CMS not sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) or similar agreements from states or vendors?
A: CMS operates under specific federal regulations prioritizing transparency and information access. CMS has the authority to conduct program reviews and audits as part of its federal oversight responsibilities. Regulations, including but not limited to 45 CFR 95.615 and 42 CFR 495.346, mandate that state agencies must provide the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with full access to their systems and records. This access encompasses all aspects of the system, such as state staff involvement, design developments, operations, and cost records of contractors and subcontractors. The primary reasons why CMS is not required to sign NDAs or similar agreements are:

1.	**Regulatory Compliance:** CMS is bound by federal regulations that require open access to information. Signing an NDA could conflict with these regulations, particularly 45 CFR 95.615, which ensures that the Department can evaluate the system's efficiency, economy, and effectiveness without restrictions.
2.	**Transparency and Accountability:** As a federal agency, CMS is committed to maintaining transparency and accountability in its operations. NDAs could limit the ability of CMS and other oversight bodies to access necessary information, thereby hindering their ability to ensure that public funds are used appropriately and that systems are functioning as intended.
3.	**Public Interest:** CMS must ensure that systems undergo scrutiny and review to protect the public interest, promote better service delivery, and safeguard against the misuse of resources and funds.
4.	**Operational Efficiency:** Allowing unrestricted access to systems and records enables CMS to conduct timely and thorough evaluations. This helps identify areas for improvement and implement necessary changes swiftly, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective service delivery. 

In summary, CMS does not enter into NDAs with states during program or system review to maintain transparency and accountability, comply with legal requirements, and effectively fulfill its oversight responsibilities. This approach ensures that CMS can fulfill its mission to provide high-quality healthcare services while adhering to legal and ethical standards.

However, this does not mean that CMS does not take steps to protect sensitive information. CMS has procedures in place to protect confidential and proprietary information, and it may enter into other types of legal agreements, such as MOU/MOA/DUA, that govern the use and disclosure of certain types of information.  To further support these efforts, CMS utilizes the Box Cloud Content Management Platform in accordance with 42 C.F.R. §§ 433.112(b)(15) and 433.116(b), (c), and (i). This platform facilitates the Streamlined Modular Certification (SMC) framework by enabling secure file exchange and storage of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Box has achieved numerous U.S. Government certifications for privacy and security, including FedRAMP Moderate, DoD SRG IL4, NIST SP 800-171, AICPA SOC 2/SOC 3/AT 101 Type II, IRS Publication 1075, and HIPAA. These certifications ensure that state files loaded in Box are secure, providing states with confidence in the safety of their information even in the absence of NDAs.


### Q5: What requirements must states comply with under SMC?
A: The SMC Guidance and MES Certification Repository presents the process, requirements, and materials states must follow under the SMC process. This includes Conditions for Enhanced Funding (CEF), outcomes, and metrics as key elements. In addition, states must complete an Operational Readiness Review (ORR) and Certification Review (CR).

### Q6: What are the key SMC process touchpoints, and how do they correspond to the IT lifecycle?
A: The SMC process is designed to support the IT investment lifecycle phases as follows:
-	**Planning – Should the APD be approved?**
  - During the Planning phase, the state submits the Advance Planning Document (APD), including proposed outcomes and metrics, to the CMS State Officer for approval.
  - For SMC, the state begins populating the Intake Form and Operational Report Workbook (ORW), which aligns with the approved APD outcomes and metrics.
-	**Development – Is the project healthy?**
  - During the Development phase, the state provides CMS monthly reports on project status in preparation for the Operational Readiness Review before system go-live.
  - For SMC, the state submits the entry criteria to demonstrate review readiness, receives confirmation on an ORR date, finalizes the Intake Form, and places all certification documentation (evidence, required artifacts, Intake Form, ORW, ORR agenda, and presentation) in the CMS Box.
-	**Production – Is the system delivering outcomes?**
  - During the Production phase, the state continues to assure CMS of the project’s health via monthly status reports and operational reports documenting how well the system performs after go-live.
  - For SMC, the state finalizes the Intake Form and submits entry criteria in preparation for CR, where the state will demonstrate the system in the live production environment. The state submits unredacted evidence, required artifacts, metrics data via the ORW, and the agenda and presentation for the CR. Once certified, the state submits the Operational APD (OAPD) to CMS for approval.


### Q7: What is the Certification Request Letter, and where do states send it?
A: States may download an example of the [Certification Request Letter Template] on the MES Certification Repository.

States should email the Certification Request Letter to their CMS State Officer and <MES@cms.hhs.gov>. It is also used as an entry criteria for scheduling a CR and a required artifact. The state must also upload the letter to the applicable Box folder for certification.


### Q8: How is the Information Request Listing used?
A: One (1) week before the review, the state will receive an Information Request Listing (IRL) for any additional clarifications. Although CMS encourages written responses to these questions before the review, this is not mandatory. The state should be prepared to address all outstanding questions from the IRL during the ORR or CR discussions and demonstrations.

## Outcomes and Metrics {#outcomes}

Please visit the [Metrics and Ongoing Reporting]({{site.baseurl}}/Ongoing Reporting/) page on GitHub for additional information.

### Q: Are there resources to help states work with their State Officers to develop appropriate state-specific outcomes and metrics?
A: States should discuss their ideas for outcomes early in the planning process so that they can be included in the APD. State-specific outcomes should be specific to the IT investment the state is making and should allow the state to demonstrate progress towards meetings its goals. Please see the SMDL and other resources on Medicaid.gov and the CMS Certification Repository on GitHub. 

### Q: Where can states find examples and more information on CMS-required and state-specific outcomes and metrics?
A: The CMS Certification Repository on GitHub provides a collaborative space where states can learn, share, and contribute information about the MES Certification process and its related artifacts. Additionally, there are tools on the MES wiki to help State Officers work with states to develop state-specific outcomes. 

### Q: When should states develop state-specific outcomes?
A: States should begin to develop state-specific outcomes and related metrics early in the planning phase and update CMS on progress throughout the IT investment cycle. 

States will need to submit to CMS for approval an Advance Planning Document (APD) that includes state-specific outcomes, and metrics. States should be in frequent contact with their CMS State Officer for support with drafting an APD that include state-specific outcomes and related metrics that clearly align the proposed IT project with the state’s goals. 

### Q: Do states need to develop state-specific outcomes for all projects?
A: In certain circumstances a project may only have CMS-required outcomes, (e.g., if a state is proposing a project to implement a new basic capability, or if the goal of the state’s project is to become compliant with a federal requirement). However, this should be exception rather than the rule. 

Additionally, states with legacy systems that are already certified and in O&M do not need to go back and create new state-specific outcomes. 

### Q: Are states expected to have a metric for every outcome? 
A: No, it is not expected that states have one metric for every outcome. One metric may be relevant for multiple outcomes in each module. Alternatively, multiple metrics may be appropriate for a single outcome. It is worth noting that not every outcome will require a metric – some may only require an attestation or demo during the Certification Review and should be noted in the Intake Form. States must work with their State Officer to discuss those outcomes that may not have metrics and receive approval.  

### Q: When and how should states report progress on CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and metrics?
A: Once CMS approves the APD, the state should enter the CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, and metrics from the APD into the Intake Form for discussion and approval with their CMS State Officer. Together, they should agree on a preliminary list of evidence that will be used to demonstrate that outcomes have been achieved. 

During ORR, the state must demonstrate that the system will support the collection and reporting of metrics described in the APD/APD-U. During CR, the state will need to demonstrate – with appropriate evidence – that the approved CMS-required and state-specific outcomes and metrics are being achieved by the system in production. States will also report on state-specific outcomes and related metrics and other elements in on-going operational reports after the CR. Please see the Guidance for more details.

CMS anticipates that states may need to revisit and update outcomes and metrics (as defined below) for their investment over time. Any revisions to a state’s CMS-required or state-specific outcomes or metrics may require submitting an APD-Update (APD-U). The state should regularly contact their CMS State Officer to discuss such updates.

### Q: What module-specific outcome materials have been developed as part of SMC?
A: Under SMC, states will select CMS-required outcomes under each relevant module. CMS-required outcomes for specific MES modules can be found in Appendix B of the SMDL. These outcomes are aligned with regulatory and policy requirements that states must follow when implementing modules or capabilities. The lists in Appendix B are the “menu” the state chooses from to select the CMS-required outcomes that are applicable for a given project.

States should also propose their own state-specific outcomes that are informed by what they are trying to accomplish for their Medicaid program. State-specific outcomes should be specific to the IT investment the state is making and should allow the state to demonstrate progress towards meetings its programmatic goals.

## Conditions for Enhanced Funding {#CEF}

Please visit the [Conditions for Enhanced Funding (CEF)]({{site.baseurl}}/Conditions for Enhanced Funding/CEFs/) page on GitHub for example evidence.  The CEF includes privacy and security (see CEF 9, 12, and 18). 

Please visit the [CEF Tips and Best Practices]({{site.baseurl}}/Conditions for Enhanced Funding/CEF Tips/) page on GitHub for additional tips and best practices.   

### Q: What is the recommended timeline for addressing privacy and security during the Design, Development, and Implementation (DDI) and Maintenance and Operations (M&O)? 
A: CMS recommends the following: 
- **System Security Plan (SSP)** – must be drafted early in the DDI as it is included in the SCA and maintained throughout M&O.  
- **Security Control Assessment (SCA)** – must be completed prior to go-live and the Security and Privacy Assessment Report (SAR) provided for ORR evidence. SCA must be completed biennially unless following Affordable Care Act (ACA) Administering Entity (AE) then annually. 
- **Penetration Test** – must be complete prior to go-live. Penetration testing must be completed biennially (strongly recommending annually) unless following ACA AE then annually. 
- **Vulnerability Scans** – must be completed continuously (recommend monthly) throughout DDI and M&O. 
- **Plan of Action & Milestone (POA&M)** – must be updated throughout DDI and M&O with all vulnerabilities, including at minimum those from the penetration test, SCA, vulnerability scans, and disaster recovery findings. Recommend using the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Administering Entity (AE) POA&M template. 
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plan** – must be drafted early in the DDI as it is included in the SCA.  The plans must be reviewed yearly throughout DDI and M&O.
- **Disaster Recovery Test** – strongly recommended to be performed yearly throughout DDI and M&O.  A test must be completed prior to go-live.

## Intake Form {#intake}

### Q: What is the Intake Form and how should it be used? 
A: The Intake Form is used by the states and CMS to track what a state is trying to achieve with a given project, including the CMS-required outcomes, state-specific outcomes, metrics, and associated evidence. Ideally, the Intake Form is started in between submission of the state's APD and submission of the state's RFP. After APD approval, states will fill out the Intake Form by including their state-specific outcomes as well as CMS-required outcomes. States will also need to identify the metrics they are using to evaluate their progress in achieving CMS-required and state-specific outcomes. 

Given that states need to include state-specific outcomes and metrics in their APDs, it is important that the Intake Form match what is listed in the APD. When a state approaches ORR and CR, they will need to meet with CMS to finalize and approve the specific evidence that the state will provide as a part of the certification process. 

The Intake Form template can be found on the GitHub Repository as well as [Medicaid.gov](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-systems/certification/streamlined-modular-certification/index.html). 

### Q: When should a state fill out the Intake Form?
A: States should start filling out the Intake Form once the APD has been approved. If a state did not complete the Intake Form as part of the APD approval and the project is nearing ORR, CMS will work with the state to complete the Intake Form with outcomes and metrics selected by the state.

***

## Certification {#certification}

### Q: Does the state need at least six months of metrics reporting from a live system in order to request to schedule a CR? 
A: No, a state does not need at least six months of metrics reporting of a live system to request a CR. However, the state must be able to provide at least six months of approved metrics (beginning from go-live) by the time of CR. Please see the SMC guidance for requirements for requesting a CR. 

### Q: Will CMS conduct an annual recertification of state investments? 
A: CMS will not be “recertifying” systems on an annual basis. Rather, states will submit operational reports containing data and/or other evidence that modules continue to meet all applicable requirements for the state’s claimed federal matching funds. Operational reports should include metric data corresponding to the agreed-upon outcomes listed in the APD for each applicable MES module.

These reports should be submitted annually in support of the Operational APD (OAPD) request, however, more frequent reporting on key operational metrics may be necessary. States will coordinate with their CMS State Officers to determine which modules and metrics may need more frequent reporting.

***

## Reporting Requirements {#reporting}

### Q: What is the monthly project status report and which states will need to start submitting these reports?
A: The monthly project status report is required during the Development phase, or DDI, (i.e., after the IAPD is approved leading up to the CR). The monthly project status reports are required as part of ORR and CR evidence. The monthly project status report helps keep CMS apprised of the progress the project is making toward achieving the CEF and desired program outcomes. The elements of the monthly project status report are described in the SMC SMDL guidance document and include information and updates related to progress tracking, the testing framework, test results, and the defect and risk list. There is an example format available on the CMS Repository on GitHub for states to use. The monthly project status report should be submitted to the state’s CMS State Officer, and either the MES mailbox (MES@cms.hhs.gov) or CMS Box.

Please see the SMC Guidance for more information.

### Q: What are operational reports?
A: After the CR, states will begin submitting operational reports. States must submit operational reports containing data and/or other evidence that modules are meeting all applicable requirements for the state’s claimed federal matching funds to demonstrate ongoing, successful system operations. These reports should be submitted at least annually in support of the OAPD request, however, more frequent reporting on key operational metrics may be necessary. Operational reports should include metric data corresponding to the agreed-upon outcomes listed in the APD for each applicable MES module. 
States should coordinate with their CMS State Officers to determine which modules and metrics may need more frequent reporting.  Please see the SMC Guidance for more information.

***

## Metrics {#metrics}

### Q: What is the purpose of metrics? Why are they required under SMC? 
A: Metrics reporting enhances transparency and accountability of Internet Technology solutions to help ensure the Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) and its modules are meeting statutory and regulatory requirements as well as the state’s program goals. In accordance with 42 C.F.R. §433.112(b)(15) and §433.116(b), (c), and (i), states must be capable of producing data, reports, and performance information from and about their MES modules to facilitate evaluation, continuous improvement in business operations, and transparency and accountability, as a condition for receiving enhanced federal matching for MES expenditures. State reporting also gives states and CMS early and ongoing insight into program evaluation and opportunities for continuous improvement. 
 
### Q: Are states required to report on all of the CMS-required metrics currently listed on GitHub? 
A: States are required to report on metrics for all projects receiving enhanced FFP. The GitHub contains recommended metrics for states to use and and are the default set for their projects and subsequent operational reporting. If states believe they can produce high value data that is more relevant to their project and business needs with an alternative set of metrics, CMS encourages the state to propose them to their State Officer. As a general rule, states should start with what is listed on GitHub when identifying metrics for relevant CMS-required outcomes and then speak to their State Officer about on what they would like to report. 
 
### Q: What should states do if they do not think the GitHub metrics are relevant for their current module under review? 
A: States should work with their State Officer to decide on the most appropriate and meaningful metrics for their project. Over time, CMS may consider periodically updating the GitHub based on the metrics proposed by states.  
 
### Q: What metric information are states expected to present at ORR? At CR? 
A: At ORR, states should have their metrics clearly defined and mapped to relevant CMS-required and state-specific outcomes. The state should be prepared to discuss the outcomes and planned metrics. States should be prepared to discuss why some outcomes were selected and not others, how the state plans to generate the identified metrics, and the expected cadence and format of reporting.

At CR, states need to have been operational for ***at least*** 6 months to receive certification. States ***must*** also provide metric data back to the state's requested retroactive certification date, for all months the system has been operational. States should be ready to discuss the numerical data presented in the operational report, anomalies in the data, changes to metric methodology, and any plans for future reporting. 
 
### Q: How much metric data are states expected to provide in order for a CR to be scheduled? 
A: In accordance with SMD #22-001, states must submit all agreed upon operational metrics related to the module, beginning from the time the system became operational as the system of record and up until the end of the most recent quarter, in order for a state to schedule their CR date. The system must by live and the state must be able to show they are collecting and able to report metric data. For example, if your state is collecting metrics on a monthly basis and you are looking to schedule a CR, you should provide all available months of data before being able to request a CR. 

We will continue to add to the FAQ as new questions arise. [Download the FAQs as a PDF.](https://cmsbox.box.com/shared/static/yd5glb19gfn2i62bsntlz8akn1tcwspf.pdf)
 
### Q: How often do states need to submit operational reports? 
A: States are required to submit operational reports on an annual basis. Although states report annually, the data should be broken down by month. The State Officer may require more frequent reporting for specific metrics.
