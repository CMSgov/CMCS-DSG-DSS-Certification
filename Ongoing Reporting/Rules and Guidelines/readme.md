# Operational Report Workbook Rules and Guidelines

The following rules, recommendations, and notes are intended to help the state fill in the Operational Report Workbook (ORW).  

## General Rules

1. Do not add columns or tabs or change the name of columns or tabs or make any changes to the ORW. 
2. Do not delete the instructions row (with the text in blue font that start with "Instruction") on the “Metric Definition” or the “Metric Value worksheets;” the code is programmed to skip this row. 
3. Do not insert blank rows. 
4. Do not merge cells. 
5. The file name must end in the date format of “_YYYY-MM-DD”. 

## Recommendations

1. Follow guidance for file naming conventions: Operational_Workbook_[2-letter state abbreviation]_[module abbreviation]_YYYY-MM-DD. 
2. Do not cross out text. For example: 
3. Text that is struck out, "Amount of recovered dollars saved from claims with TPL.~~ reimbursements.~~" 
    - Is read as, “Amount of recovered dollars saved from claims with TPL. reimbursements." 
    - If the state wants to resubmit data, the state should update the filename with the new submission date (the previous data will be overwritten).   
4. Highlighting or font customization will not be captured or retained. 

## Notes

1. It is the state's responsibility to review all decisions regarding its metrics with the CMS State Officer at the earliest point of recognition that a metric should be changed or retired. 
2. Supplemental files that the state submits with the ORW will not be processed and will be retained in the submission folder.
