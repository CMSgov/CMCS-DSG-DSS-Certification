### CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Requried outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements. CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demostrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations which pertain to that a specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. 

| **Reference Number** | **Outcome** | **Recommended Metrics** | **Relevant&nbsp;Regulatory Sources** | **Recommended Reporting Periodicity** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Reference Number] | [Outcome statement]  | - [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.]<br /><br />- [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.] | [link to regulation(s)] | [recommended periodicity] |
| [Reference Number] | [[Outcome statement] | - [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.]<br /><br />- [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.] | [link to regulation(s)]              | [recommended periodicity]             |

### Related State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

State-Specific Outcomes focus on improvements to the Medicaid program not specifically addressed by the CMS-required outcomes. States that are requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill *state-specific program needs,* beyond minimum legal requirements, should propose, and work with the CMS State Officer to finalize, outcomes that address the proposed functionality. Additionally, state-specific outcomes may reflect the unique circumstances or characteristics of the state or territory and its Medicaid program.
