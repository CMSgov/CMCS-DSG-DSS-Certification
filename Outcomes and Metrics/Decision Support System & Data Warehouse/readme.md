### CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements. CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations which pertain to that a specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. 

| **Reference Number** | **Outcome** | **Recommended Metrics** | **Regulatory Sources** | **Minimum Reporting Periodicity** |
| :-- | --- | --- | :-: | :-: |
| DSS/DW1 | The system supports various business processes' reporting requirements.  | - Verify and validate the CMS annual report provisions from 431.428 (1) through 431.428 (11) are met annually. | 42 CFR 431.428 | Annually |
| DSS/DW2              | The solution includes analytical and reporting capabilities to support key policy decision making. | - Produce data-driven reporting on transaction data and performance to meet 433.112 (b) (15). |     42 CFR 433.112     | Annually or Quarterly if possible |

### State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

*State-Specific Outcomes* focus on improvements to the Medicaid program above and beyond baseline of the *CMS-required outcomes.*

States which are requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill *state-specific program needs,* beyond minimum legal requirements, should propose *State-Specific Outcomes* which address the proposed enhancements.

*State-Specific Outcomes* should target specific problems and derive Medicaid program benefits. For more information on constructing and writing *good outcomes* see our page  "Writing-Outcome-Statements". 

In the table below, we provide a listing of State-Specific Outcomes that have been approved by CMS. Each row includes: 

* The state which created the outcome and metrics and the assocaited Medicaid program goal;
* The outcome statement;
* The assocaited metric(s) linked to the outcome statement, and; 
* The periodicity for reporting metric data to CMS.
