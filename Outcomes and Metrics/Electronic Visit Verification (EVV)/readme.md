# Electronic Visit Verification (EVV)
#### How this system supports the Medicaid Program 

[intro text]

## CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements. CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations which pertain to that a specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. 

The EVV Required Outcomes and Metrics can be found on the [Medicaid.gov EVV Outcome Based Certification page](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-systems/outcomes-based-certification/electronic-visit-verification-certification/index.html). We will be integrating EVV outcomes and metrics into this repo over time.
