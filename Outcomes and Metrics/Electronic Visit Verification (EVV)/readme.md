# Electronic Visit Verification (EVV)

#### How does this system support the Medicaid Program

Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) is a system under which visits conducted as part of Personal Care Services (PCS) and Home Health Care Services (HHCS) are electronically verified with respect to (i) the type of service performed; (ii) the individual receiving the service; (iii) the date of the service; (iv) the location of service delivery; (v) the individual providing the service; and (vi) the time the service begins and ends.

## CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements or a requirement for receiving system approval from CMS, otherwise known as systems certification. CMS-required outcomes and metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations that pertain to that specific system or module. CMS-required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations.

| Reference Number | CMS Required Outcomes | Default Metrics | Required Evidence | Regulatory Source |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| EVV01 |  |  |  |  |
| EVV02 |  |  |  |  |
| EVV03 |  |  |  |  |
| EVV04 |  |  |  |  |
| EVV05 |  |  |  |  |

The following tables include guidance on filling out the Metric Definition tab in the Operational Report Workbook (ORW). Note: “Frequency” refers to the capture of the metric data while “cadence” addresses the timing of report submission to CMS.

| Metric Element | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **Name** | Association of EVV record to claim/encounter |
| **Outcome Reference #** | EVV01 \| EVV02 \| EVV03 \| EVV04 \| EVV05 \| EVV06 |
| **Description** | To ensure that claims and encounters are not being paid for unverified visits. |
| **Value Type** | Percent |
| **Numerator** | Number of paid claims and encounters that have complete EVV visit records associated with them |
| **Denominator** | Number of paid claims and encounters for PCS and/or HHCS |
| **Reporting Frequency** | Monthly |
| **Definitions** | HHCS – home health care service<br/>PCS – personal care service<br/>Complete EVV record: all required data elements are captured in the record. According to the 21st Century Cures Act, these are  <br/>1) the type of service performed <br/>2) the individual receiving the service<br/>3) the date of the service<br/>4) the location of service delivery<br/>5) the individual providing the service<br/>6) the time the service begins and ends |
| **Additional Guidance** | Claims and encounters counted in this calculation are those that are non-duplicative and were paid during the quarter.<br/>This metric does not stipulate how a state chooses to associate an EVV record with its corresponding claim or encounter. This metric is reported for the previous quarter, which allows the state to account for a complete quarter of data. For example, the first quarter’s results are reported in the second quarter. |

## State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

States requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill _state-specific program needs,_ beyond minimum legal requirements and the baseline of the _CMS-required outcomes_, should propose _State-Specific Outcomes_ which address the proposed enhancements.

When drafting state-specific outcomes statements, keep [these tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing-outcome-statements) in mind.

### Examples for this Electronic Visit Verification

We are actively gathering and evaluating outcomes statements crafted by states for this business area.

Please send examples from your state that you'd like to share to <MES@cms.hhs.gov>. Our team will collect and share the best examples.
