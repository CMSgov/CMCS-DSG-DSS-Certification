## CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements. CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations which pertain to that a specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. 

| **Reference Number** | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Outcome**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Recommended Metrics**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                      | **Regulatory Sources** | **Minimum Reporting Periodicity** |

## State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

States requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill *state-specific program needs,* beyond minimum legal requirements and the baseline of the *CMS-required outcomes*, should propose *State-Specific Outcomes* which address the proposed enhancements.

When state-specific outcomes statements, keep [these tips](https://cmsgov.github.io/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Certification/writing-outcome-statements) in mind.
