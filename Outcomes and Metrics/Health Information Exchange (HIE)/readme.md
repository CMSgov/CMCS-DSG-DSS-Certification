# Health Information Exchange (HIE)

#### How this system supports the Medicaid Program

A Health Information Exchange allows medical information to be accessed and shared by patients and health care providers, leading to improved coordination of care and better community monitoring.

## CMS-Required Outcomes

None. There are no CMS-Required outcomes for HIE.

As such, for an HIE system to be certified states will need to create or reuse State-Specific Outcomes which target state-specific problems and derive Medicaid program benefits.
