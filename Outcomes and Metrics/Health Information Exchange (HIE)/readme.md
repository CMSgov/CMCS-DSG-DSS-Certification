# Health Information Exchange (HIE)

#### How this system supports the Medicaid Program

Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) allows patients and health care providers to access and share medical information across hospitals/provider networks/health systems. Depending on the nature and extent of a given HIE’s capabilities, investments are expected to lead to improved individual- and population-level health outcomes through improved coordination of care and the use of data to inform health policy decision-making.

## CMS-Required Outcomes

None. There are no CMS-Required outcomes for HIE.

For an HIE system to receive enhanced funding, states will need to identify outcomes and associated metrics that show clear benefits to their respective Medicaid programs (i.e., the HIE must be able to show how its reach extends beyond individual patients to advance the state’s overall Medicaid objectives).

## State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

The state is responsible for drafting State-specific outcomes and metrics.  These should detail the benefit to Medicaid program.

When drafting state-specific outcomes statements, keep [these tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing-outcome-statements) in mind.

### Examples for Health Information Exchanges

While each HIE is unique, common system capabilities are listed below. Some are technical, but a good outcome will focus less on the technology itself and more on the business functions and/or programmatic objectives that the technology enables/facilitates/advances.

-	**Event Notification Services** -	Event Notification Services keep providers informed of any current admissions, discharges, or transfers (ADTs) for their empaneled patients.  Well-informed providers can better coordinate care, reducing duplication of services and minimizing any gaps, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and reduced costs to the Medicaid program.
-	**Care Coordination/Clinical Data Exchange** -	With Clinical Data Exchange, providers utilize a portal or in-workflow viewer to access clinical data (imaging, consult reports, etc.) originating from outside their own Electronic Health Records (EHRs).  Continuity of Care Documents (CCD) are the most frequent type of clinical summary exchanged, although several states are also offering registries for patient advance care directives/Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (i.e., ensuring that patient desires are respected during critical moments).
-	**Direct Secure Messaging** -	Encrypted, secure messages (via the Direct protocol) are exchanged via the healthcare organization's EHR and/or an HIE-operated portal. 
-	**Public Health – Public Health Registries and Reporting** -	Through this capability, the HIE facilitates exchange of immunization records, electronic lab reports (eLRs), syndromic surveillance messages, electronic case reports (eCRs), Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) records and other data of interest to public health agencies.
-	**Population Health Analytics/Support to Value-Based Care Initiatives** -	The state utilizes clinical and/or administrative data stored in the HIE to identify Medicaid members for potential individual-level interventions (high utilizers, missed vaccinations, etc.), as well as to identify opportunities for potential benefit improvements/demonstrations.
-	**Quality Reporting** -	Many HIEs make data available to support meeting state and federal requirements for reporting standardized clinical quality metrics.
-	**Emergency Response** - Emergency response capabilities, such as Patient Unified Lookup System for Emergencies (PULSE), enable medical emergency responders to view clinical and medication histories of individuals who have been displaced (typically due to natural disasters) and must seek care outside their normal, routine settings.

Many states are leveraging their HIE infrastructures in support of other Medicaid program priorities that involve multi-provider coordination/collaboration, including closed-loop referral systems for health-related social needs and inpatient/sub-acute bed availability registries. 
States may have unique and novel uses of their HIE not represented above, and we welcome those outcome statements crafted by states to update this listing. Again, HIE investments (and thus their outcome statements) must demonstrate a benefit to the respective states’ Medicaid programs in addition to the individual members that are the subject of an ADT message, immunization report, etc.
