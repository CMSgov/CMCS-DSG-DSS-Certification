## CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements.
CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is

specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for
system/module functionality, which must continue to continue to receive enhanced
federal funding for operations.
