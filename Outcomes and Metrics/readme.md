# What Makes a Good Outcome Statement?
An Outcome Statement should describe the measurable improvement(s) to a stateâ€™s Medicaid program that will be realized once the project is complete. Additionally, Outcomes should support the priorities of the Medicaid program, be directly enabled by the stateâ€™s Information Technology project, and should include a Measurement, which utilizes data as evidence that the Outcome(s) are being met on an ongoing basis. The following elements comprise an Outcome Statement:

* Module - Functional business area of the Medicaid Enterprise that is being enhanced or replaced.
* Program Goal - Identifies the benefit to the Medicaid program upon implementation.
* Outcome Statement - A statement on how the project will measurably benefit the Medicaid program. The Outcome Statement should correlate to the Program Goal.
* Measurement - A product of a formula that correlates to the Outcome Statement, which reflects whether or not the outcome was realized.
