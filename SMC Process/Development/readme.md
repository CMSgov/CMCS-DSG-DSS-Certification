# Development

At the beginning of the Design, Development, and Implementation (DDI) phase, the state should develop a Master Test Plan, in consultation with the Testing Guidance Framework. The Master Test Plan describes in detail how the testing is being planned and how it will be managed across different test levels. It gives a bird’s eye view of the key decisions taken, the strategies to be implemented, and the testing effort involved in the project. 

If a state is using agile methodology or is taking a phased approach to implementation, the state and its CMS State Officer will decide the appropriate point at which to conduct the ORR and CR. The state must map the phases to the applicable CMS-required and state-specific outcomes to help the CMS Certification Team determine when to hold the ORR and CR.

To provide regular project updates, monthly project status should be submitted to their CMS State Officer and the MES mailbox (MES@cms.hhs.gov). The project status reports should be loaded to the appropriate CMS Box folder (as discussed and agreed to with CMS SO) starting at the beginning of the project and continuing until the CR is completed or until the CMS SO agrees it is no longer needed.

## Operational Readiness Review (ORR)
The state must undergo an ORR with its CMS State Officer prior to releasing its system/module into production. CMS encourages states to include all appropriate programs, business operations, and IT subject matter experts in the ORR.

The state will be able to schedule its review no more than three months in advance of the target date. For example, if the state intends to hold an ORR in March, then they can submit their request for the review as early as December. 

To schedule an ORR, the state must provide the following entry criteria:
-	Anticipated go-live date. 
  -	Go/No-Go Exit Criteria is well documented and defined. 
-	Testing completion timeline for all testing, but User Acceptance Testing at minimum (for a full list of testing see MES Testing Guidance Framework)  
-	Link to CMS Box location
  -	Please work with your CMS State Officer who will set up a file structure in CMS Box.
-	Anticipated privacy and security assessment completion dates for the following (these are evidence in Conditions for Enhanced Funding): 
  -	Independent Security Assessment (ISA) conducted within the last 2 years.
  -	Independent penetration tests conducted within the last 2 years.
  -	POA&M documenting the status of vulnerabilities.
  -	Proof of 508 compliance (e.g., VPAT)
  -	Disaster Recovery Plan and Test Results

For the ORR, the following steps are completed:
1.	The state finalizes the state columns of the Intake Form.  
2.	Preferably earlier but no later than two weeks before the ORR, the state uploads all evidence, required artifacts listed within Appendix C of the SMC Guidance, the Intake Form, the ORR agenda, and the presentation the state will use for the ORR in CMS Box. 
  a.	No files uploaded to CMS Box should be redacted, this includes but is not limited to security risk assessments, penetration tests, screen prints, or reports that include PHI/PII.
  b.	The state also sends the completed Intake Form to the CMS State Officer and to MES@cms.hhs.gov. 
  c.	The CMS Certification Team will then begin a review of the evidence and required artifacts. 
3.	Approximately one week prior to the review, an Information Request Listing (IRL) will be sent to the state by the CMS Certification Team. This includes questions and feedback on the files uploaded to CMS Box. The state should respond in writing by the time of the review and modify the agenda to address feedback from the CMS Certification Team during the review.
4.	The ORR meeting is held, and action items are documented, reviewed, and agreed to. 
  a.	The state should try to respond to all action items as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours.
5.	A Tear-out will be created by the CMS Certification Team including observations, recommendations, and action items. The Tear-out will be sent to the state along with an updated Intake Form (with CMS columns filled out) approximately one week after the ORR meeting.
6.	The Tear-out recommendations should be reviewed, and action taken as necessary (not required) as the state’s response will need to be reviewed during the CR. The state should continue working with its CMS State Officer to address all observations as the project goes into production and in preparation for the CR.
