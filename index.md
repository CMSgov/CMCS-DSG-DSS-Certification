# What is this CMS Certification Repository?
The CMS Certification Repository on GitHub will provide a collaborative space where states can learn, share, and contribute information about the MES Certification process and its related artifacts. We created this repository for CMS, states, and vendors to:
* Access the latest-and-greatest information about CMS-Required outcomes and recommended metrics
* Create and contribute to the community of state-specific outcomes and metrics
* Access examples of well-defined outcomes and metrics

This repository will also host rules of behavior governing how the information should be used and interaction norms.
[Placeholder for governance plan to define how and when information is updated and who is responsible for making changes]

# What is GitHub?
GitHub is a hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. No coding necessary, all you need is a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account and Internet access. You donâ€™t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).
