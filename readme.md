# Welcome to the CMS Certification Repository

The CMS Certification Repository is a space for states, CMS, and vendors to learn, share, and contribute information about the MES Certification process and its related artifacts. From this site you can access the latest-and-greatest information about CMS-Required outcomes and recommended metrics as well as view CMS approved state-specific outcomes and metrics.

## Recent updates

- UI bugfixes were implemented and we fixed several bugs when users tried to download CMS-Required CSVs
- All business areas/module pages were updated with CMS-Required Outcomes and recommended Metrics
- The visual styling for tables was merged to improve the look and feel of the site.

## Getting Started

### Intake Form

The Intake Form Template is used throughout the Streamlined Modular Certification process to track information about a state MES project for certification. It is tailored for each state project. States will fill out the Intake Form Template by entering the CMS-required outcomes that document compliance with regulations applicable to their project, their state-specific outcomes, and the metrics used to show that the project is achieving its outcomes on a continuous basis. 

The template here contains CMS-required E&E outcomes as an example of how content should appear in the Intake Form. A blank copy of the intake form is also available on [Medicaid.gov](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-systems/certification/streamlined-modular-certification/index.html).

### Outcomes and Metrics

The Outcomes and Metrics in this repository is organized by MES business areas on the left. Certification is still required if your project does not neatly fall into one of the business areas. You may still find relevant outcomes and metrics examples across other business areas. As needed, work with your state team and State Officer to create state-specific outcomes statements.

## Contributing
The MES team will be iterating on the site over time and would love to know how it can be improved. We are also actively gathering and evaluating outcomes statements crafted by states across all business areas. If you are interested in sharing examples to be hosted on this site, send them to: <MESCertificationRepo@cms.hhs.gov>. 

If you have any other feedback or suggestions please email them to <MESCertificationRepo@cms.hhs.gov> and our team will get back to you.
