# Welcome to the MES Certification Repository

The Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) Certification Repository is a space for states, CMS, and vendors to learn, share, and contribute information about the MES Certification process and its related artifacts. From this site, you can access the most current information about CMS-required outcomes and default metrics, as well as examples of CMS approved, state-specific outcomes and metrics.

## Getting Started

This repository organizes outcomes and metrics by MES modules in the left-hand menu. The SMC Guidance further explains what falls within the scope of systems approval (certification) and expectations related to the conditions for the receipt of enhanced funding. States are expected to collaborate with their state business stakeholders and CMS MES State Officer to create state-specific outcomes statements.

### Intake Form

The Intake Form Template tracks information about a stateâ€™s MES module for certification throughout the SMC process. The template is tailored for each state project.  States will enter (1) all of the CMS-required outcomes for the module associated with their project, (2) their state-specific outcomes, and (3) the metric IDs that show that the project is achieving its outcomes continuously.

Please reach out to your State Officer to get a blank copy of the Intake Form or a copy of the Intake Form pre-populated for EVV.

Additional guidance on how to use the Intake Form is available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/Intake Form/).

### Additional Templates

The [Templates Page]({{site.baseurl}}/Templates/) contains a list of required and recommended certification-related templates.

## Recent Updates

This site is an evolving resource, with quarterly major releases as needed. CMS employs a standard semantic release versioning of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, which uses the following format:

- MAJOR version release when CMS makes significant changes, such as posting new outcomes, rewriting existing outcomes, and adding/editing metrics, required documents, or processes.
- MINOR version release when CMS adds edits to the site or contextual clarifications that do not substantially change any core content.
- PATCH version release when CMS makes minor edits, such as typographical corrections, bug fixes, and other non-substantial edits.
