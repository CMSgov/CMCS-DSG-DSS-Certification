# Welcome to the CMS Certification Repository
The CMS Certification Repository is a space for states, CMS, and vendors to learn, share, and contribute information about the MES Certification process and its related artifacts. From this site you can: 
* Access the latest-and-greatest information about CMS-Required outcomes and recommended metrics
* Contribute to and view well-defined state-specific outcomes and metrics

# Recent updates you should know about
