# MES Certification Repo Roadmap

This page shows the currently planned features and functionality that are in store for this repo. We are expecting constant interation to be continiously delivered, however this roadmap provides a sense of direction and priority.

While we continue to work on the items in the roadmap using the Near, Far, and Really Far categorization, [click here to see recent changes (commits) that we've made to the repo.](https://github.com/CMSgov/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Certification/commits/main)

## Near

1. More user testing with states, State Officers, & vendors
2. CSV linked tables/data (integrating back-end outcomes/metrics with front end UI)
3. Review and Revise the CMS-Required outcomes and metrics wording to ensure they are aligned to "Outcomes Best Practices" in regards to what makes a "good outcome"
4. Including URL link to the relevant eCFR citation for each outcome

## Far

1. Create a discussion space/sandbox for all users to brainstorm or explore ideas around outcomes and metrics
2. Create a process to allow non-CMS staff to submit content to the repo via issues/PRs
3. Map currently active state projects to the repo's business areas
4. Create new business areas based on state's projects and refine the module/business area definitions
5. Expand the content in the repo to include other related certification documents such as roadmap, acceptance letter, test plan, and more

## Really Far

1. Link the outcomes repo to the eAPD to allow for a "shopping cart" like experience for users looking to add outcomes to their eAPD
2. Use the outcomes repoo to auto-populate the certifiation intake
