# Writing a Good Outcome 
States requesting enhanced Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) should propose state-specific outcomes that demonstrate the successful achievement of the MES project, confirm the system functionality, and show benefit to the Medicaid program. State-specific outcomes should target achieving improvements to distinct business, operational, or policy challenges that produce direct benefits to the Medicaid program. These outcomes should respond to the unique needs of a state’s Medicaid program and represent operational improvements not specifically addressed by the CMS-required outcomes.

A good state-specific outcome helps a state monitor the desired functionality and efficiency of its Medicaid program and operations. States should collaborate with their CMS State Officer to finalize state-specific outcomes that comply fully with Medicaid statutes and regulations, as well as a set of metrics that assure a practicable assessment of the proposed module’s effectiveness. States can draw on the process and considerations in this document to write good state-specific outcomes and determine effective metrics for their measurement and assessment.

## Identify the State-Specific Outcome
Technology should enable better program outcomes. How does the project align with the goals of the state’s Medicaid program and therefore provide a benefit beyond technical specifics? 

To begin, states should (1) clearly define the primary objective of their MES project initiative and (2) focus on the desired result that addresses the state’s specific challenge or need.

### Examples:
-	**"Increase the number of Medicaid patients who can schedule appointments online."** This target of this outcome is improving patient access to scheduling services, which addresses current issues with accessibility and convenience.
-	**"Expand the provider directory of active Medicaid providers, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.”** This outcome focuses on expanding and maintaining the accuracy of the provider directory. The successful result helps assure adequate capacity to serve expected enrollments in a given service area while maintaining a sufficient number, mix, and geographic distribution of providers.

## Checklist

The table below presents a checklist for a state’s approach and considerations for drafting good state-specific outcomes.

| Step | Action | Things to Consider |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Align with Medicaid Program Goals |  |

| 8 | Use Clear and Concise Language |  |
| 9 | Reassess State Needs and Update as Needed | <ul><li>**Reassess:** Reevaluate state-specific outcomes and metrics periodically to ensure continued relevancy.</li><li>**Update:** Once goals have been achieved, modify, archive, and/or add new metrics that meet current state and CMS needs.</li></ul> |
